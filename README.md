Instructions for API Key Configuration

To enhance the security of API credentials, my YoutubeAPI Key and TMDB API Key are not publicly shared. Consequently, the project cannot be executed unless the necessary API credentials, including the YoutubeAPI Key and TMDB API Key, are provided.

To obtain API credentials:

Please visit:

https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started 

https://console.cloud.google.com/

Then create an Info.plist file in the project and name it Keys.plist

Add your TMDB API Key and YoutubeAPI Key inside Keys.plist

Run the application.

Or contact me at lenispath@gmail.com to obtain the necessary API credentials for running the application.
